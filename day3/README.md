# Advent of code Day 3 Challenge

## Observations
Probably could be done more efficiently.
The enum is not needed, but let's face it learning rust is not 'needed'.
Initially had the idea of using a enum for matching the score, then found out I had to match the char to the enum.
Could have just used the match char to determine the scores, but like using the enum as well.

## Location of Coding

Part 1 was created in Illigan City during the family vacation to the Philipines.
Part 2 was created on the Kho Shipping Lines Boat trip from Iligan City to Siqujior.

## Sources

Got the char matching code from stack overflow:

Comparing 3 strings was hard, first I used the compare function I build for task 1, but it kept giving me wrong results.
In the end I asked chatgpt for a function that could compare 3 strings.

Cool challenge, finally had the feeling that I was coding myself in Rust!
